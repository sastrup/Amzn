## Simple tool for item analysis in Amazon's FBA program
* Initially built to help me with my company's listing and sourcing
    * We primarily list books so initial development uses only isbn for searches
* Powers our app to help potential leads qualify their books themselves
    * User enters isbns they wish to sell on our site
    * We use the package to bounce these leads off our business model
    * User can then decide to move forward with our offer(s), if any
