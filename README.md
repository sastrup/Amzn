## Simple tool for item analysis in Amazon's FBA program
* Initially built to help me with my company's listing and sourcing
    * We primarily list books so initial development uses only isbn for searches
* Powers our app to help potential leads qualify their books themselves
    * We use the package to bounce these leads off our business model and pre-qualify them
